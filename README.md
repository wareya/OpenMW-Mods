`chestfix2` - Fix the contents of Com_Chest_11_k01 to match what they were before Bloodmoon, rather than being nearly empty. For many dungeons, a few copies of this chest is basically all the reward you get.

`crescent_crash_workaround` - At some point in the game you gain access to an item with "Crescent" in its name that causes you to teleport to another scene. For some reason, when doing this content, at some point during it, I crashed. I debugged the issue and made this addon for myself so that I could finish that content. I *do not* remember the details, or even what point in the content the crash happened. I do not know whether this addon is still needed.

`Late DB Attack` - Delay Dark Brotherhood attacks: if you reach level 5, or start the main quest (specifically doing the puzzle cube quest), or do the back door quest, or finish the main quest, then DB attacks are enabled. Otherwise they're disabled. This delays the attacks long enough to not confuse new players without making it hard to access the content that's locked behind them.
